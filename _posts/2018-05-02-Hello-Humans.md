title: Hello Humans!
---

Here is a first post on GitHub and I turn to my last in twenties. Phew..! life passes fast.. isn't it?

Well, time ticks at it's own pace. So much to learn and so less time. 

World is running and so are we. Run.. chase your dreams.. rise and shine.. but remember, we are humans blessed enough to enjoy mother earth.

> Life is a journey, enjoy all ups and downs.

Cheers..! Until I update this post :)
