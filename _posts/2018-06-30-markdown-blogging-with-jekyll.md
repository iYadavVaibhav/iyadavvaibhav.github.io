Markdown is fastest and minimalistic way to do basic format editing to documents without moving away from keyboard.

This post has notes on setting up environment and best practice for blogging in MarkDown using Jekyll. If you directly reached here then you might need to go through some setup and things I did before blogging with Jekyll. 

So, this post is third part of related posts.

## The Setup
I am using Mac, GitHub and Jekyll for blogging.

Editing tool I am using is Sublime Text 3.1.1

This version of Sublime text comes with support for markdown and provides very minimum syntax highlighting.

## Extending Sublime Text for Markdown Support:
If you want more syntax highlighting and better preview of what you write then you can extend Sublime Text by installing  package.

Type: ``Cmd + Shift + P`` to open package manager.

Then type ``install package`` and hit enter.

This will provide you list of available packages from packagecontrol.io

Next when you get dropdown type ``Markdown`` and this will list you all markdown related packages.

You can select ``Markdown Editing`` to install the package. 

This provides much better highlighting and preview.

I, personally, didn't like it much and was a bit distracting for me.

So I removed this package. But you may like it.

## Removing a packege from Sublime Text:
To remove the package, simply press ``Cmd + Shift + P`` and the type ``remove package``.

This will give you list of packages installed and you can select ``Markdown Editing`` to remove it.

## End Notes
Hope this helps you, do check out my related post to help you setup things better.
