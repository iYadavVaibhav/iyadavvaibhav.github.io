GitHub can be used for personal site and blog.

It can further be used to project sites. This is kind of a sub-site/sub-domain of main site.

My site:
```myname.github.io/```

Project Site:
```myname.github.io/abc_project/```

All projects repository come under **gh-pages** branch and not master.

Creating a sub site is same as creating a main site.
