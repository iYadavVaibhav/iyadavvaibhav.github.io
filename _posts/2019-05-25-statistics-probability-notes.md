# Statistics

## Summarizing Quantitative Data
Mean median and mode are three ways to summarize the data and measure the central tendency of data. These are usually found for quantitative data. 

### Mean
Average or mean are one and the same thing. It is some of all the data points divided by number of data points. 

### Median 
It is the middle number. We find it by sorting the entire dataset into an ordered list. If it's even then it is sun of two middle number by two else it's the middle one. 

### Mode
It is the most *common number* or the most frequent number in the dataset. 

#### Effect of Outliers
Removing a big outlier decreases the mean more but less change on median and we may be median doesn't change.

## Spread or Variation of Data

The spread of data can be measured by its range, interquartile range (IQR), variance or standard deviation. 

### Interquartile Range 
It is the difference in the middle of the first half and the middle of second half. Median divides the dataset into two different parts. We then find the median of these two different parts and find the difference. 
If we have even number of data points in dataset then we include the first middle number in first set and the second middle number in second set.

IQR is useful to find out how much the data is varying. 

Range can be misleading when we have outliers. But in this case interquartile range can give us much better measure of spread of data.
