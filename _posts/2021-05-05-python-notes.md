## Anaconda and Conda Notes with Jupyter and R Studio

**Anaconda** is toolkit for Data Science.
- it includes ds and ml libraries along with conda, and 
- other tools like jupyter, rstudio etc.

**Conda** is package manager and environment manager, like pip,
- it can install packages and 
- can manage envs 
- It is a CLI

**Anaconda Navigator** is GUI to use conda.

Conda Basic Commands:
- `conda config --set auto_activate_base false` disables autoload base
- `conda update conda` updates conda
- `conda install PACKAGENAME ` installs pkg to default/active env
- `conda update PACKAGENAME ` updated pkg
- `pip install pkg` aslo intalls to active env

Conda Env Commands:
- `conda create --name py35 python=3.5` created new env and installs py 3.5
- `conda activate py35` activates
- `conda list` lists all akgs installed ina ctive env.

**Jupyter** name comes from Julia, Python and R,
- formerly known as *IPython Notebook*
- it is pkg, same as flask
- `pip install jupyter` or it comes installed in Anaconda dist.
- `jupyter notebook` runs a server to server jupyter notebooks at http://localhost:8888/tree

**R and RStudio** are statistical language and IDE,
- `r` or `R` - R console in terminal
- `Rscript my.r` - executes file in terminal
- `Rscript -e "getwd()"` - executes cmd in terminal, can quickly install a library.
- `R CMD BATCH my.r` runs R script and saves output to `my.r.Rout`
- To make R Script executable like `./my.r` then:
  - set permission to 755
  - add correct `#!` to top of file

```r
#!/usr/bin/env Rscript
sayHello <- function(){
   print('hello')
}

sayHello()
```

## Regex Notes:

Remove single line comments // from code:
- `\/\/.*$\n` - Finds all single line comments starting with //.
  - `\/\/` - string has //
  - `.*` - then has anything after that
  - `$\n` - then matches next line as well.
