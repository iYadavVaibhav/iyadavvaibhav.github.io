# SA4

## Linear Regression 

Relation in Y and X such that X variables explain Y

Why do LR:
- Relation: Understand relation between X and Y, e.g.
  - Relation of sales on profit
- Prediction: To make predictions about Y variable

**Problem:** Anita wants to predict the number of toys she can sell in coming half year.

Step 1: Modeling: Develop a regression model
- identify the variables: proce/advertising cost/promotion costs
- Variables are not exhaustive
- SalesUnits = $\beta_0 + \beta_1 Price + \beta_2AdExp + \beta_3PromExp$
- Beta_s are coefficients,
- signs expected are: b1 -ve, b2 +ve, b3 +ve

Step 2: Estimation: Using software to estimate the model
- prior data, collected over time
- use excel/r/python and get refgression output
- this gives coeffiecients, the betas
- get expected signs of betas

Step 3: Inference: Interpreting the estimated regression model
- $SalesUnits = -25096.83 - 5055.27Price + 648.61AdExp + 1802.61PromExp$
- beta means when X increase by **one unit** y increases by beta times, keeping others constant.
- beta0 is Y when all X are 0.
- beta0 is fixed cost of production, without making any unit.

Step 4: Prediction: Making predictions about Y variable
- put value of Xs and betaS and get Y value.
- create 3 scenarios, how much to set price, how much to send on ad and promotions, based on these scenarios we get Y that can help us decide.

Results:
95% time on Modeling, 5% on rest steps.

Assumptions:
- Hypothesis testing on the regressions:
- $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \epsilon$
- here e is the error.
- these errors are normally distributed around avg value 
- avg of errors is 0, $\epsilon_i ~ N(0,\sigma)$

- in regression output we do have result of hypothesis test, as p-values

Why is p-value imp:
- tells significance of X in explaining Y,
- *when p is low, null has to go*


# Session 2

Problem a): Test the Hypothesis that price has no effect on sales

Answer: Check hypothesis on beta1 ehich is coefficient of Price.

$H_0: \beta_1=0$
$H_1: \beta_1 \neq 0$

- Check this using confidence interval from refression output.
- lower 95% = -6153.32 and upper 95% = -3957.22
- hecne, beta1 != 0
- also, p value = 6.2E.09, which is low, null has to go.
- We reject the NULL Hypothesis, Ho, so sales is dependent on price.

Problem b): Company would agree to proposal of 25 cents drop in toy price if there is evidence that price reduction would lead to *at least* an increse of 1500 unit sales.

Answer:
- When price inc by 1 then Sales inc by $\beta_1$ units.
- when price dec by 1 then Sales inc $-\beta_1$ units.
- when price dec by .25 then => Sales inc $-\beta_1/4$ units.

$=> H_0: -\beta_1/4 \geq 1500$ and $H_1: H_0$ not true

$=> H_0: -\beta_1 \geq 6000$ and $H_1: \beta_1 < 6000$

$=> H_0: \beta_1 \leq -6000$ and $H_1: \beta_1 > -6000$

- This single tail test, solve using CI in summary table.

- to do

Problem: Car

Answer: 
- Y variable is gasoline required for 100 miles.
- Y column = 100/MPG
- Run regression, from output,

- Weight - for every 1000 lb increase in weight of car, the gasoline required to travel a 100 miles increases by 1.56 gallons, all other varibales kept at the same level.
- Horsepower 
  - since p-value is more than alpha hence it is not significant in explaining Y. 
  - This seems wrong and is a pitfall of regression, will be covered in multi-co-linearity.
  - this should be checked as, from common sense, horsepower effects mileage.
- R square 
  - the variance explained by residuals is 92%, 
  - there is variation in Y variable because some have high efficiency some low.
  -  It can explain 92% of this variablility in fuel efficiency, 
  - how much variation gets explained is R-square. 
  - 92% is high, hence, model will make good predictions.
- What impacts fuel efficiency the most?
  - we cannot depend on coefficient as it is unit dependent.
  - p-value are used as cut-offs to rule out the coefficient.
  - 1sd change in weight, has coeff sd change in Y, 1sd change in weight is 1.01 sd change in Y. hence weight has more impact.

# Focused Session on Big Data Analytics

Find a polar bear in images from cameras in forest.
- use azure iot to get images from camera
- `devices.json` has camera lat, long, key and id.
- create cloud-shell, this gives bash shell on azure.
- create a resource group (project) on azure., 'streaminglab-rg'
- create storage account 'mysamg1'
- create storage account keys to allow camera to store files to your account.
- create disk space(container) named photos(dir)
- create 'azure iot hub'AIH to recieve photos in realtime. AIH can listen to multiple IOT devices at the same time. 'myhubmg1'
- get connection string to the hub, to access the cameras.
- deploy 10 camera array to AIH, they will send camera snap in some interval.
- On laptop, use node.js for sending photos (simulated cam, else cam kernel will talk to AIH)
- npm install AIH
- create devices.json has {lat: "", long: "", key: "", device_id: "").
- create deploy.json
- node deploy.js, read devices.json, the register to AIH
- key is populated for each devices once it is registered on AIH.
- to store photos, you need `azure-storage` pkg, install using node.
- create `test.js` to upload an image to AIH with camera device id, lat, long, timestamp details.
- Create 'stream analytics job'SAJ under IOT, 'polar_bear_analytics', this will take input from AIH and send the image to 'Vision Analytics'
- stream, clean, not all photo to ml
- In SAJ we can query based on window, timestamps, camera or other dimentions of data.
- SAJ -> Computer Vision APi (CVA), for this use cloud-functions
- go to function app, make func, (streaminglab-rg)
- create 'http trigger func' 
- now cretae 'run.js' that simulates real time, it uploads in random time interval.
- start SAJ
- SAJ sends filtered data to clout function which at the moment logs to console.

## Custom Vision 
- Create resource 'polar bear r1'
- kind: CognitiveServices
- the upload training images with tags.
- do quick training of the model.
- now publish this model to get a web-api. 
- we can use this web-api in our cloud ml function, then save the perdiction result to sql server.
- create sql server, myservermg1,
- configure the server to allow zure services, create db and table.
- update the function with js code to read preds from web-api and store results in db.

For counting, use regression model.

# ML Classes:

ML in practise:
- most of the time goes in ML model building
- Auto ML does not works always
- data -> model -> predict
- Learning - 
- p-value tell if the model is correct. it is confidence
- missing values and outliers k liye seek domain guy/customer
- touch more on inference side.
- number has no value, inference has value in corp.

K-means algorithm, hands on:
1. decide number of cluster, k=2
2. initialize random data points as c1(x1, y1), c2(x2, y2).
3. now find eucladian distance (ED) between between all the points and all the centroids.
4. ED = [x1-x2)^2 + (y1-y2)^2]^0.5
5. now the point belongs to centroid to which they have minimum distance.
6. now calculate new c1, c2 by finding average of all new points belonging to the cluster.
7. repeat step 3 to 6, until you get same c1,c2 as in last iteration.

K-Means Variations:
- logic and flow remains same, but we can change the way we calculate the distance, hamming, manhattan etc. This changes the centroid and the point belonging to it.

Business Scenario ðŸ’¼ :
- Client may say that no, point A belongs to other cluster
- Change clustering method/k value/etc
- so no clustering is best, it can only be acceptable, by client.

Hierarchical Clustering:
- Find dist of each point with everyother point. 5C2.
- create a 5X5 matrix with values as distance bw points
- in dendogram, y-axis is ED between points and x-axis is points.
- This is agglomerative clustering.
- Now any cut on Y axis gives us the clusters.
![Hierarchical Clustering](../images/hierarchical_clustering.png "Hierarchical Clustering")

Uber Case Study:
- Kmeans clustering to find centroid as place from where all rides can be catered. 

## Knowledge Graphs

Patters:
- How different subjects are related, find the connections, eg, Trump Boeing, Binny Bansal and Infosys.
- if business prob requires connections then build graphs
- Subject is node, edge is relationship.
- we can analyse customer care text data, and get insights
