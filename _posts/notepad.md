# Flutter Notes
- Framework to develop mobile/web apps
- Everything is a widget
- uses DART as a programming language
- code gets compiled to java/javascript/swift for native performance.

Initial steps:
- `flutter create --org com.codeo myapp` create a basic app
- `flutter pub get` gets all packages
- `flutter run -d Chrome` runs flutter app on device chrome
- `pod setup` makes ios deploy faster
- `flutter build web/apk` builds app for publishing

Structure:
- assets - hold images/fonts
- lib - all the dart code
  - we can make folders specific for activity
  - models - hold class for data in the app like users.dart, deserialize json
  - pages - hold screens, each .php page or route
  - widgets - component on pages, like progress bar
- all folders are packages, eg, lib package, src package, models package.

Architectures (State Management):
- Flutter allows to use many kind of state management architectures like Redux, BLoC, MobX and many more.
- These all are commonly used architecture to layer out UI from Database/WebAPIs.

Basic Workflow:
- make product class, init constructor, add factory, the get and set functions
- link this to sqflite
  - have a db_provider
  - and an init function
  - crud functions
- or firebase
  - get reference of a collection in instance.
  - from ref get the snapshots and build.

BLoC - Business Logic Component
- separates UI from Business logic (Database and Network).
- `Sink<data>` - data in - events
- `Stream<data>` - data out - state

![BLoC diagram](https://www.mobindustry.net/wp-content/uploads/bloc-architecture.jpg "BLoC image")

![BLoc Flutter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felangel/bloc/master/docs/assets/bloc_architecture.png "BLoC Flutter")

![BLoC Pattern](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*MqYPYKdNBiID0mZ-zyE-mA.png "Bloc Pattern")

- BLoC component converts a stream of incoming events into a stream of outgoing states. 
- Close bloc references in despose() methods.
- It has:
  - Bloc
  - BlocBuilder
  - BlocProvider

- Reactive Programming, whenever there is new data coming from the server. We have to update the UI screen

- **KeyNote:** *never make any network or db call inside the build method and always make sure you dispose or close the open streams.*

- Single Instance - all screens have access to bloc, there is one instance in the app
- Scoped Instance - only widget to which the bloc is exposed has access

- PublishSubject: Starts empty and only emits new elements to subscribers. There is a possibility that one or more items may be lost between the time the Subject is created and the observer subscribes to it because PublishSubject starts emitting elements immediately upon creation.
- BehaviorSubject: It needs an initial value and replays it or the latest element to new subscribers. As BehaviorSubject always emits the latest element, you canâ€™t create one without giving a default initial value. BehaviorSubject is helpful for depicting "values over time". For example, an event stream of birthdays is a Subject, but the stream of a person's age would be a BehaviorSubject.

- We pass the blocProvider to MaterialRoute and then it houses all the variables to be passed. This acts as inheritedWidget.



Redux:
- provides routing as well
- works with store reducer concept

ScopedModel
- Updates only model in scope, not the whole widget tree
- Have to notifyListeners() on each state change

  - [The Essential Guide to UI Engineering](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS2-V7v1NhNQB66bFNIXlQ_83chw0TgK6)

Development:
- `add(a,b) => a + b` creates function inline and returns valuel, can be without name.
- `setState(){}` - rebuilds the app. usually used in onTap(){}.
- wrapping parameters in {} make them named params and we have to specify the name when passing them in call. eg: `emp({String name, Int age})`, when called, `emp(name: 'Jon', age: 34)`.
- `initState() {}` function gets executed in every State ful widget. can be used to call all what we want to initialize, like db fetch etc.
- `<Future>` needs to be handled. Either we can use `.then((data) {...})` or we can add keywords `async...await` to the functions.
- `factory` before a func declaration makes it accessible outside class just like static.
- To preserve state of app, use mixin keep alive.
- await and async are good to wait for a process to finish and the execute the rest.

Navigation:
- We can generate route on the go with Navigator.pop or push.

Function calling:
- When work needs to be done on call, then pass refrence.
- When function builds/returns then call with ()s.
- Here is the difference:
  - onPressed: \_incrementCounter is a reference to an existing function is passed. This only works if the parameters of the callback expected by onPressed and \_incrementCounter are compatible.
  - onPressed: \_incrementCounter() \_incrementCounter() is executed and the returned result is passed to onPressed. This is a common mistake when done unintentionally when actually the intention was to pass a reference to \_incrementCounter instead of calling it.

# Regex Notes:

Remove single line comments // from code:
- `\/\/.*$\n` - Finds all single line comments starting with //.
  - `\/\/` - string has //
  - `.*` - then has anything after that
  - `$\n` - then matches next line as well.

# Firebase Notes

Firebase is cloud based, app-backend service that is scalable and it helps in authentication, database, file storage, hosting, crashlytics, messeging, adMob, analytics, campaigns etc. 

It has following components:

- ML Kit
  - Has in build ML models for text analytics, image recongnition etc.
  - Works on device or on cloud
  - Can add Tensor flow functions/models to firebase functions and it will be hosted and serverd.

- Firebase Authentication
  - Google, fb, twitter etc
  - Account based
  - Gives back user information, unique_id, name, photo,
  - manages sessions

- Cloud functions
  - responses to event, like welcome email on sign in
  - triggers on database events
  - modify files uploaded
  - send cloud messaging messages to other users.
  - build API from database
  - All written in JS using node and then deployed using CLI

- Firebase Hosting
  - Static files hosting
  - on SSD, serves SSL, 
  - can host PWA

- Firebase Storage
  - Store files, secure them, reliable.

- Firebase Realtime Database
  - Store and sync data in realtime, even offline
  - It is NoSql database.

GCP
- SaaS, PaaS
- compute engine VMs, app engine(dockers and containers)
- Cloud ML
  - Offers pretrained models with biggest library.
  - Cloud Vision API, Video Intelligence

  - NLP API, Translations,  Text2Speech, Seech2Text API
  - Auto ML trains on your data using expertise from already trained neurals
  - Provides interface to train, evaluate and proof onjects on your own data.
  - SaaS with latest TensorFlow, PyTorch and SKLearn on VMs with TPU and GPU support


## Firestore Notes
- It is NoSQL database storage engine in firebase
- Works online and offline
- Sotores data in collections

Initialization:
- create database
- create table, called collection, users
- create rows, called document, doc_id

Connecting apps:
- iOS:
  - add GoogleService-Info.plist in xCode 
  - add reverseClientId in key CFBundleURLSchemes Runner/info.plist
- android:
  - add google-services.josn and 
  - make sure applicationId is correct in app/build.gradle

Reading data (Flutter):
- Create a reference to instance of a collection, `userRef = Firestore.instance.collection('users')`.
- The above has functions to fetch records as snapshot of data
- It returns future which need to be handled.
- use StreamBuilder
- stream: Firestore.instance.collection('users').snapshots(),
- reference object accepts chain of functions like `where()..orderBy()..limit()` etc. for compound queries.
- `FutureBuilder` - reads data in database
- `StreamBuilder` - provides stream to data, shows new user added.

NoSQL Structuting:
- do not nest collections
- keep data flatten
- copy data but mostly stored in the way it is best to be fetched.

Create/Update/Delete data (Flutter):
- onTap: () => record.reference.updateData({'key': new_value})
- now its all linked from front to back
- all sync and updates offline and online.
- reference has function like `add()..updateData()..delete()`. They all return `<Future>`.

Triggers:
- user firestore triggers to listen and act on the change in a collection.
- It uses node js to write and deploy the functions.
- Triggers can be created by using Trigger functions. Steps:
  - `firebase login` - login to your google account to use CLI.
  - `firebase init fucntions` - create fucntions folder in flutter project.
  - `firebase deploy --only functions` - deploy functions to firebase cloud.
