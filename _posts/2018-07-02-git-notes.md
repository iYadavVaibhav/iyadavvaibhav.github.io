Notes on my understanding of Git and GitHub

Now that we have all set up, [local Git and it connects to GitHub](/setting-git-and-github-on-mac).

On any folder, do this **once**

`git init` this will create git repository.

`cat .gitignore` add files that you want git to ignore

For every other **updates**, do this:

`git add .` adds files to git or pass . to add all

`git diff` shows changes made to files

`git commit -m "New changes"` commits to git with message

This will create a local git repository on your local drive. Now if you need to add this to a remote git repository, for example, a repository github.com then you need to add remote to this folder. 

`git add remote [name] [url]` will add remote. 

Once remote is added to your local git then you can push or pull the files based on the commands below. 

`git pull` if changed online or pushed another git then can pull updates to local

`git push` push the changes to GitHub
