Notes on my understanding of Git and GitHub

Now that we have all set up, [local Git and it connects to GitHub](/setting-git-and-github-on-mac).

On any folder, do this **once**

`git init` this will create git repository.

`cat .gitignore` add files that you want git to ignore

For every other **updates**, do this:

`git add .` adds files to git or pass . to add all

`git diff` shows changes made to files

`git commit -m "New changes"` commits to git with message

`git pull` if changed online or pushed another git then can pull updates to local

`git push` push the changes to GitHub

## Emac Basic
Press `ctrl + c + x` to save and exit a file.
