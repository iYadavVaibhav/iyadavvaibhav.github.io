Notes on my understanding of Git and GitHub

Now that we have all set up, [local Git and it connects to GitHub](/setting-git-and-github-on-mac).

On any folder, do this **once**

`git init` this will create git repository.

`cat .gitignore` add files that you want git to ignore

For every other **updates**, do this:

`git add .` adds files to git or pass . to add all

`git diff` shows changes made to files

`git commit -m "New changes"` commits to git with message

This will create a local git repository on your local drive. Now if you need to add this to a remote git repository, for example, a repository github.com then you need to add remote to this folder. 

`git remote add  [name] [url]` will add remote. Here, `name` can be origin and `url` is url of git repo created online on GitHub.com

Once remote is added to your local git then you can push or pull the files based on the commands below. 

`git pull` if changed online or pushed another git then can pull updates to local

`git push` push the changes to GitHub. We can also specify name and branch here. eg:
`git push -u origin master`.


## Setting Git and Github on Mac


GitHub is excellent for code repositories online. GitHub pages is good for making your work available over the internet.

GitHub Pages further pushed me to learn Git, GitHub and Jekyll (blogging with GitHub pages).

These notes can help you setup Git on Mac and link it with GitHub account.

I have followed an excellent [post](https://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/) by Karl Broman on the same. You can find summary of his guide below:

## 1. Install Git
Git is version controlling that can be installed locally. 

## 2. Setup RSA for SSL
RSA is used for making safe authentications via SSL.

## 3. Setup GitHub Account
You will get an online space to upload your code with version controlling.

## 4. Use Git and GitHub
THis will help you sync your local code repositories with online one.

## 5. GitHub pages and blogging with Jekyll
Now that you have all set up, you can setup GitHub Pages to launch your site.
Further, if you want to blog on your site you can setup Jekyll.

Follow this post, [Setting Jekyll Now on GitHub] to get started with blogging and personal site.
