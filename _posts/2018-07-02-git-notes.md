Git Overview:
- Git is a distributed version-control system (VCS) for tracking changes in source code during software development. 
- We check-in and check-out files to git and it keeps a track of the history.
- On mac it was pre installed as part of Xcode Command Line Tools.
- `git --version` to check the version of git installed.

Setting up Git on a folder (local repository):
- On any folder, do this **once**
- `git init` this will create git repository.
- `cat .gitignore` add files that you want git to ignore

For future updates to code, do this:
- `git add .` adds all files to git or pass . to add all
- `git diff` shows changes made to files
- `git commit -m "Message"` commits to git with message

This will create a local git repository on your local drive. Now if you need to add this to a remote git repository, for example, a repository on github.com or bitbucket then you need to add remote to this folder. 

Adding remote:
- `git remote add  [name] [url]` will add remote. Here, `name` can be origin and `url` is url of git repo created online on GitHub.com
- Once remote is added to your local git then you can push or pull the files based on the commands below. 

Syncing local and remote:
- `git pull` if changed online or pushed another git then can pull updates to local
- `git push` push the changes to GitHub. We can also specify name and branch here. eg:
  - `git push -u origin master`.


## Adding RSA for password free sync on Mac

GitHub is excellent for code repositories online to share work, collaborate or keep a backup.

I have followed an excellent [post](https://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/) by Karl Broman on the same. To summarise the flow:
- Install git on local drive. 
- Setup RSA for SSL: RSA is used for making safe authentications via SSL.
- Setup GitHub Account: You will get an online space to upload your code with version controlling.
