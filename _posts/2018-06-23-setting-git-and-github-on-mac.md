GitHub is excellent for code repositories online. GitHub pages is good for making your work available over the internet.

GitHub Pages further pushed me to learn Git, GitHub and Jekyll (blogging with GitHub pages).

These notes can help you setup Git on Mac and link it with GitHub account.

I have followed an excellent [post](https://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/) by Karl Broman on the same. You can find summary of his guide below:

## 1. Install Git
Git is version controlling that can be installed locally. 

## 2. Setup RSA for SSL
RSA is used for making safe authetications via SSL.

## 3. Setup GitHub Account
You will get an online space to upload your code with version controlling.

## 4. Use Git and GitHub
THis will help you sync your local code repositories with online one.

## 5. GitHub pages and blogging with Jekyll
Now that you have all set up, you can setup GitHub Pages to launch your site.
Further, if you want to blog on your site you can setup Jekyll.

Follow this post, [Setting Jekyll Now on GitHub] to get started with bloggin and personal site.
