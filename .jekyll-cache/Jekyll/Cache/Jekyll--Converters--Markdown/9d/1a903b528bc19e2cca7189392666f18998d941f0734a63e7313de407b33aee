I"¾<p>Logistic Regression is mainly used when we have to work on probability. It outputs values between 0 and 1. So 0.5 is cutoff point and anything below 0.5 goes to class 0 and rest to class 1.</p>

<p>Logistic is also called <strong>Sigmod</strong>. Shown in function below.</p>

\[\phi (z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}\]

<p>this always outputs b/w 0 and 1.</p>

<h3 id="difference-between-logistic-and-linear-equations">Difference between logistic and linear equations</h3>

<p><strong>linear model:</strong>  $ y = b_0 + b_1x $</p>

<p>where as logistic is shown in equation below (also same as $\phi (z)$ eq above) :</p>

\[p = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(b_0 + b_1 x)}}\]

<h3 id="model-evaluation">Model Evaluation</h3>

<p>Use <strong>confusion matrix</strong> to evaluate classification model.</p>

<p>Classifiaction model is when we classify our predisctions against test data.</p>

<p>Confusion matrix puts predictions and tests together to compare.</p>

<p>False Positive FP is Type 1 error
FN is Type 2 error</p>

<h3 id="accuracy">Accuracy:</h3>

<p><strong>Correct:</strong> (TP + TN) / total = 150/165 = 0.91</p>

<p>Our model is 91% correct,</p>

<p><strong>Wrong:</strong> (FP + FN)/100 = 15/165 = 0.09</p>

<p>Our mode is 9% wrong.</p>
