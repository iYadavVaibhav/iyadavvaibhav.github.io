<h2 id="the-setup">The Setup</h2>
<p>I am using Mac, GitHub and Jekyll for blogging.</p>

<p>Editing tool I am using is Sublime Text 3.1.1</p>

<p>This version of Sublime text comes with support for markdown and provides very minimum syntax highlighting.</p>

<h2 id="extending-sublime-text-for-markdown-support">Extending Sublime Text for Markdown Support:</h2>
<p>If you want more syntax highlighting and better preview of what you write then you can extend Sublime Text by installing  package.</p>

<p>Type: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Cmd + Shift + P</code> to open package manager.</p>

<p>Then type <code class="highlighter-rouge">install package</code> and hit enter.</p>

<p>This will provide you list of available packages from packagecontrol.io</p>

<p>Next when you get dropdown type <code class="highlighter-rouge">Markdown</code> and this will list you all markdown related packages.</p>

<p>You can select <code class="highlighter-rouge">Markdown Editing</code> to install the package.</p>

<p>This provides much better highlighting and preview.</p>

<p>I, personally, didnâ€™t like it much and was a bit distracting for me.</p>

<p>So I removed this package. But you may like it.</p>

<h2 id="removing-a-package-from-sublime-text">Removing a package from Sublime Text:</h2>
<p>To remove the package, simply press <code class="highlighter-rouge">Cmd + Shift + P</code> and the type <code class="highlighter-rouge">remove package</code>.</p>

<p>This will give you list of packages installed and you can select <code class="highlighter-rouge">Markdown Editing</code> to remove it.</p>
