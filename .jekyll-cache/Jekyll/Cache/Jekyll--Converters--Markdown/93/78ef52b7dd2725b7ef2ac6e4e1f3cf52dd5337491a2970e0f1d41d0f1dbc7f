I"0<p>Here is my first post on GitHub using Jekyll and I turn to my last in twenties. Phew..! life passes fast.. isn’t it?</p>

<p>Well, time ticks at it’s own pace. So much to learn and so less time.</p>

<p>World is running and so are we. Run.. chase your dreams.. rise and shine.. but remember, we are humans blessed enough to enjoy mother earth.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Life is a journey, enjoy all ups and downs.</p>

<p>Here, I basically write notes of what I learn and what I do. This helps me refer back and keep a log of how I did something. I was saving my notes locally and randomly so thought of putting them onto GitHub to centralize them and make them available to the world.</p>

<p>A few posts here might not be very well document or in polished manner as they are quick notes to refer back. However, I do include the most essential part and try not to break the flow in understanding a concept.</p>

<p>Thanks for landing here, and remember:</p>
