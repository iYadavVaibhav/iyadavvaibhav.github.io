I"4<p>NumPy (or Numpy) is a Linear Algebra Library for Python, the reason it is so important for Data Science with Python is that almost all of the libraries in the PyData Ecosystem rely on NumPy as one of their main building blocks.</p>

<p>Numpy is also incredibly fast, as it has bindings to C libraries. For more info on why you would want to use Arrays instead of lists, check out this great <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/993984/why-numpy-instead-of-python-lists">StackOverflow post</a>.</p>

<p>Important aspects of Numpy: vectors,arrays,matrices, and number generation.</p>

<h2 id="numpy-arrays">Numpy Arrays</h2>

<p>Arrays are used to represent Vectors and Matrices.</p>

<p>Vector 1-d</p>

<p>Matrix 2-d (can be 1X1 as well)</p>

<h3 id="arange">arange</h3>

<p>we can build array using this.</p>
