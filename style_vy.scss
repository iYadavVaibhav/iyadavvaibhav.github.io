// IMPORTS

@import "reset";
@import "variables";
// Syntax highlighting @import is at the bottom of this file



// Settled on moving the import of syntax highlighting to the bottom of the CSS
// ... Otherwise it really bloats up the top of the CSS file and makes it difficult to find the start
@import "highlights";
@import "svg-icons";
